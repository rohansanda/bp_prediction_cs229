# PPG-based BP Prediction ##
### CS 229 Final Project ###
#### By Rohan Sanda and Edward Kim ####

To run our models, go to the /models folder and run run.py. You will need to specify a data path and provide processed data in a pickle file format as our files were to large to upload and store on Github. 

/models contains the autoencoder, feature extraction, and neural network code.
/processing contains the processing code and some data analysis code
/results contains the pickle files from and weights from different experiments
